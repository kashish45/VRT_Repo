        Locally advanced cervical cancer poses significant challenges in patient care due to its complexity and the need for multidisciplinary treatment approaches. Patients often require a combination of therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, to achieve optimal outcomes. Each patient's journey is unique, with variations in disease progression, response to treatment, and overall prognosis. In Japan, treatment practices for Stage III cervical cancer typically reference national guidelines, favoring radical hysterectomy combined with para-aortic lymph node dissection followed by postoperative chemotherapy. Despite these standard practices, there is a continuous search for innovative therapies that can improve survival rates and quality of life for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.
            Overview of Cervical Cancer
            Anatomy of the Female Reproductive System:
            •	The uterus is located between the bladder and rectum. It consists of the uterine corpus (upper 2/3) and cervix (lower 1/3). The cervix connects to the vagina and has two types of cells: epithelial and stromal cells, separated by a basement membrane.
            •	Lymphatic metastasis from cervical cancer primarily affects the pelvic lymph nodes (around the uterus) and para-aortic lymph nodes (around the abdominal aorta). Pelvic lymph node dissection is performed when metastasis is suspected.
            Site of Origin of Cervical Cancer:
            •	Cervical cancer originates in the cervix, and the type of cancer depends on the location and type of epithelial cells involved. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from the squamous epithelial cells near the cervix, while adenocarcinoma arises from columnar cells near the uterine corpus.
            •	The squamocolumnar junction (SCJ), where squamous and columnar cells meet, is the primary site of cervical cancer.
            Clinical Symptoms of Cervical Cancer:
            •	Early stages (e.g., squamous intraepithelial lesions, CIN): Often asymptomatic.
            •	As cancer advances, symptoms include abnormal bleeding, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, and dyspareunia.
            •	Metastasis can cause lymph node enlargement, respiratory symptoms (lung metastasis), and bone pain (bone metastasis).
            Risk Factors:
            •	The major cause is persistent HPV infection (over 95% of cases), particularly high-risk types 16, 18, 52, 58. HPV testing can determine the presence of these high-risk types.
            •	Smoking is also a significant risk factor for developing cervical cancer.
            •	Prevention is possible through HPV vaccination, which can prevent infection with HPV types 16 and 18 (responsible for 60-70% of cervical cancers). The 9-valent vaccine covers additional types, potentially preventing over 90% of cervical cancers.
            Classification of Cervical Cancer:
            •	Histologically, cervical cancer can be squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 70% of cases, while adenocarcinoma accounts for 20-25%.
            •	Precursor lesions:
            o	Squamous cell carcinoma can develop from mild to severe dysplasia, progressing to carcinoma in situ.
            o	Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells, with various subtypes, including endocervical adenocarcinoma and mucinous carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is often more difficult to detect and treat due to its deeper location and resistance to therapies.
            Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (SIL) and CIN:
            •	CIN classification: CIN 1 (mild dysplasia), CIN 2 (moderate dysplasia), and CIN 3 (severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ).
            •	LSIL/HSIL: Based on cytology, LSIL (low-grade SIL) and HSIL (high-grade SIL) indicate HPV infection or precancerous changes.
            •	It takes about 5-10 years for mild dysplasia to develop into carcinoma in situ, with a 5-10% progression rate.
            Types of Cervical Cancer:
            •	Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Most common, typically occurs in women in their 50s but can affect younger women. Early stages are asymptomatic, and advanced cases can cause bleeding and pain.
            •	Adenocarcinoma: Increasing in frequency, especially in younger women. It is difficult to detect early and is more prone to lymph node and ovarian metastasis, with a poorer prognosis than squamous cell carcinoma.
            Cervical Cancer by Site of Origin:
            •	Vaginal Portion: Often detected early by screening.
            •	Cervical Canal: Harder to detect, especially in older women. Adenocarcinoma commonly arises here, making early detection challenging.
            Epidemiology:
            •	The incidence of cervical cancer in Japan increased from the 1970s, particularly among women aged 20-39, likely due to HPV transmission through sexual activity.
            •	In 2019, the mortality rate was 2.179, second only to ovarian cancer.
            •	Survival rates vary by stage:
            o	Stage I: 92.9% 5-year survival.
            o	Stage II: 75.5% survival.
            o	Stage III: 58.2% survival.
            o	Stage IV: 26.7% survival.
            •	Histological survival rates: Squamous cell carcinoma (79.8%), Adenocarcinoma (75.6%).
            Prognosis After Recurrence:
            •	Recurrence within the irradiation field has a poorer prognosis, with a median survival of 12.6 months. However, recurrence outside the irradiation field has a better prognosis with a median survival of 45.9 months.

            Diagnostic and Staging Approach
            1.	Cervical Cancer Tests:
            o	Cervical Cytology: A screening test examining cell morphology to detect abnormalities. It's minimally invasive and performed using a spatula, brush, or cotton swab to collect cells from the cervix. The test focuses on the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ), where HPV infection occurs. Results are categorized using the Bethesda system, which includes various grades of abnormalities like low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade (HSIL) lesions. If abnormalities are found, further examinations like colposcopy and biopsy are performed.
            o	HPV Testing: Two methods are used:
            	HPV Nucleic Acid Detection: For detecting high-risk HPV, especially in cases with atypical squamous cells (ASC-US). If positive, further biopsy is performed.
            	HPV Genotype Determination: Performed in CIN1/CIN2 cases to predict progression and guide screening intervals.
            o	Colposcopy: A detailed examination using magnification to assess lesions found in cytology. Acetic acid processing and a green filter help visualize abnormalities.
            o	Cervical Biopsy: Performed if cytology results indicate abnormalities. Various biopsy methods include targeted biopsy, endocervical curettage, and Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP). Biopsy results can show CIN1, CIN2, CIN3, or carcinoma in situ, which influence treatment decisions.
            2.	Imaging Diagnosis:
            o	Imaging is essential for staging cervical cancer, particularly in evaluating tumor size, parametrial invasion, lymph node metastasis, and distant spread. Techniques include MRI, CT, FDG-PET, and FDG-PET/CT. MRI is commonly used for local staging, especially T2-weighted images, and for post-treatment monitoring.
            3.	Diagnosis Process:
            o	Cytology screens for abnormalities; if any are found, a biopsy confirms the diagnosis.
            o	If cervical cancer is confirmed, imaging is used to stage the cancer and plan treatment.
            This comprehensive approach to diagnosis involves screening, HPV testing, detailed examination via colposcopy, biopsy for definitive results, and advanced imaging for staging and treatment planning.
            The classification of cervical cancer stages has evolved significantly, with the introduction of new methods and terminologies. The shift from the "clinical stage classification" to "stage classification" integrates not only physical findings before surgery but also imaging techniques (CT, MRI, PET/CT) and pathological findings from biopsy and resected specimens. This more comprehensive approach helps assess tumor size, extent of invasion, and lymph node metastasis more accurately.
            Key Changes:
            •	Para-aortic lymph node metastasis: Previously classified as distant lymph node metastasis in stage IVB, it is now classified as stage IIIC2 in the JSOG 2020 and FIGO 2018 classifications. This distinction is important as the KEYNOTE-826 study still uses the old FIGO 2009 classification, where it remains as stage IVB.
            •	Stage IA vs. Stage IB: In stage I, a differentiation is made based on the 5 mm depth of stromal invasion, which is critical for determining the need for postoperative adjuvant therapy.
            •	Stage II: This stage is characterized by tumor spread beyond the cervix, to the lower 1/3 of the vaginal wall, but not reaching the pelvic wall.
            •	Stage III: At this stage, surgery is typically not an option due to the tumor’s spread. Differentiating features include tumor reaching the lower 1/3 of the vaginal wall or pelvic wall, and the presence of pelvic lymph node or para-aortic lymph node metastasis.
            •	Stage IV: Cancer at this stage has spread significantly, with stage IVB indicating distant metastasis to organs or lymph nodes. Chemotherapy becomes the primary treatment for this stage. Key indicators for stage IVB are lesser pelvis involvement and distant metastasis.
            In summary, the newer JSOG 2020 and FIGO 2018 classifications emphasize a more comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to cervical cancer staging, reflecting both anatomical spread and imaging findings. Understanding the differences in stage classifications is crucial, especially in interpreting clinical studies and treatment decisions.

            o	FIGO Staging:
            	Early stages (IA–IB): Defined by localized invasion.
            	Locally advanced stages (IB2–IVA): Characterized by lymph node involvement or adjacent organ invasion.
            	Advanced stages (IVB): Presence of distant metastasis.
            2.	Histopathological Analysis:
            o	Confirms squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma.
            o	Excludes rarer types like neuroendocrine carcinomas or sarcomas.

            Treatment Modalities

            Cervical cancer treatment involves surgery, radiation, chemotherapy (+ bevacizumab), or a combination (CCRT) depending on the cancer's stage and the patient’s health. Surgery is often the first choice, especially for early-stage cancers, while radiation and CCRT are used for higher stages or recurrence. Chemotherapy is primarily for stage IVB and recurrent cancers. Recent updates in 2023 recommend the use of Keytruda + bevacizumab or their combinations for chemotherapy in advanced cases. Though chemotherapy is not listed as a standard postoperative therapy in guidelines, many Japanese institutions use it for patients with intermediate to high recurrence risk.
            Treatment Flow
            •	Precancerous Lesions (CIN 3, AIS) & Stage IA: Surgical treatments like cervical conization are used to determine the stage and proceed with subsequent care based on resection margins and vascular invasion.
            •	Stage IB and II: Surgery and radiation therapy are the main treatments. For larger tumors (>4 cm), radiation is more common in Western countries, while surgery remains preferred in Japan for many stage IB and IIA cases. Adenocarcinoma may have different treatment preferences, with surgery generally better than radiation for stage IB and IIA adenocarcinoma.
            •	Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy for Stage IB and II: Adjuvant therapy is based on recurrence risk. Low-risk cases are monitored, intermediate-risk patients may receive radiation or CCRT, while high-risk cases are treated with CCRT. Chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy is not standard but is used in Japan under clinical trials.
            •	Stage III and IV: Radiation therapy and CCRT (cisplatin) are key treatments. For stage IIIC (T1, T2), surgery is sometimes considered in Japan but lacks clear evidence for preference. Stage IVB may involve chemotherapy with bevacizumab. In the 2023 update, the combination of Keytruda and bevacizumab is recommended for chemotherapy in stage IVB.
            •	Recurrent Cervical Cancer: For recurrence, particularly pelvic or local, salvage radiation therapy is an option. If chemotherapy is needed, the combination of Keytruda and bevacizumab or single-agent cemiplimab is suggested.

            1. Early Stages (IA–IB):
            •	Surgical Options:
            o	Simple hysterectomy for microinvasive cancers.
            o	Radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy for larger tumors.
            •	Adjuvant Therapy:
            o	Radiation ± chemotherapy for patients with risk factors like lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI).
            2. Locally Advanced Stages (IB2–IVA):
            •	Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CCRT):
            o	Combines external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
            o	Considered the standard of care but limited by suboptimal outcomes for advanced cases (5-year relapse-free survival: ~64%).
            •	Emerging Therapies:
            o	Immunotherapy (e.g., Keytruda) is being integrated into standard care to enhance outcomes for high-risk patients.
            3. Advanced/Recurrent Stages (IVB):
            •	Systemic Therapy:
            o	Chemotherapy ± bevacizumab improves survival but remains palliative.
            o	Immunotherapy (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors like pembrolizumab) for PD-L1-positive cases.
            •	Clinical Trials:
            o	Innovative regimens combining immunotherapy and targeted therapies (e.g., KEYNOTE-826 and BEATcc trials).


            Surgical Treatment
            Surgical options include cervical conization, hysterectomy, and various radical procedures, with radical hysterectomy being prevalent in Japan, especially for stage IB-IIB cases, under the Okabayashi procedure. This procedure also influences treatment for stage IIIC, with a preference for CCRT and surgery for T1 and T2 cases. Radical trachelectomy allows fertility preservation by removing cancerous cervix tissue while maintaining the uterus. Minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy, robotic) has gained popularity, but studies like the LACC trial show better prognosis with abdominal radical surgery.
            •	Postoperative Complications
            Common complications include urinary issues, constipation, lymphatic problems (lymphocele, lymphedema), ovarian failure, and ileus.

            Radiation Therapy
            Types of Radiation Therapy:
            1.	Radical Radiation Therapy: Aimed at curing cervical cancer without surgery, combining external beam radiation and brachytherapy.
            2.	Postoperative Radiation Therapy: Applied after radical surgery to prevent recurrence in high-risk patients.
            3.	Salvage Radiation Therapy: Used for residual or recurrent tumors after initial treatment.
            4.	Palliative Radiation Therapy: Relieves symptoms such as pain and bleeding when cure is not possible, especially in cases of metastasis.
            Methods of Radiation:
            •	External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT): Involves delivering radiation from outside the body using devices like linear accelerators. Techniques include:
            o	3D-CRT (3D Conformal Radiation Therapy): Tailors radiation fields to the tumor's shape.
            o	IMRT (Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy): Adjusts radiation intensity to minimize damage to surrounding organs, especially useful for targeting tumors in challenging locations.
            o	VMAT (Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy): A type of IMRT that uses continuous radiation delivery to reduce treatment time and minimize organ movement effects.
            •	Brachytherapy: Involves placing a sealed radiation source inside or near the tumor. For cervical cancer, this can be:
            o	Intracavitary Irradiation: A special applicator is inserted into the uterus or vagina to deliver radiation.
            o	Interstitial Irradiation: Direct insertion of needles into the tissue to target the tumor with radiation.
            o	3D-Image Guided Brachytherapy (3D-IGBT): Uses CT or MRI to precisely control radiation dose delivery to tumors and nearby organs.
            Treatment Strategy:
            •	Radical Radiation Therapy: Typically combines external beam radiation (whole pelvis irradiation) and brachytherapy for localized high-dose treatment. The use of central shielding in 3D-CRT helps minimize radiation to nearby organs like the bladder and rectum.
            •	Postoperative Radiation: After surgery, radiation therapy aims to target residual disease, often using external beam radiation. IMRT is becoming more common due to its ability to reduce gastrointestinal and urinary complications compared to traditional 3D-CRT.
            Complications:
            •	Acute Adverse Events: Include dermatitis, cystitis, diarrhea, and myelosuppression, typically occurring during or shortly after treatment.
            •	Late Adverse Events: Include proctitis, rectal bleeding, small bowel issues, vaginal adhesion, and lower extremity lymphedema, which can develop months or years after treatment.
            •	Differentiating radiation-induced complications from immune-related adverse events (irAEs) from treatments like Keytruda is crucial, as they require different management strategies.
            Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CCRT)
            •	Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy increases the tumor’s radiosensitivity, allowing for a reduced radiation dose, which lowers damage to normal tissues and reduces adverse effects.
            •	Increasing the tumor's radiation sensitivity enables the use of a lower radiation dose, enhancing the treatment's effectiveness while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.
            Radical Radiation Therapy Schedule for Cervical Cancer
            •	Treatment Variations: The radiation therapy schedule depends on FIGO staging, patient health, and hospital guidelines.
            •	Standard Treatment: Typically, five external beam radiation sessions per week, with one or two intracavitary irradiations weekly.
            •	Chemotherapy: Cisplatin is administered at 40 mg/m² once a week during radiation cycles (5-6 cycles).
            •	Postoperative Radiation: Standardized to five weeks of pelvic irradiation with no brachytherapy or central shielding.
            •	Cervical Cancer Treatment Guidelines: CCRT is recommended for high-risk recurrence groups, and postoperative radiation therapy is suggested depending on recurrence risk factors.
            Radiation Dose for Cervical Cancer Radiation Therapy
            •	Radical Radiation: External beam radiation doses range from 1.8-2 Gy per session, and intracavitary radiation typically delivers 5-6 Gy, with doses adjusted based on the cancer's stage.
            •	Postoperative Radiation: Standardized to 40-50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions with no brachytherapy or central shielding.
            Recommendations for Radiation Therapy in Cervical Cancer Treatment Guidelines
            •	General Recommendation: CCRT is recommended for all stages of cervical cancer, except stage IIIC (T1, T2), and extended-field radiation is suggested for stage IIIC2.
            •	Stage IVB: Radiation therapy is proposed for oligometastatic lesions and for symptom management in severe cases.
            •	Postoperative Radiation: CCRT is recommended for high-risk recurrence groups, with options for radiation alone or CCRT for intermediate-risk groups.
            Flow of Cervical Cancer Radiation Therapy
            •	Cooperation: Radiation therapy is a collaborative effort between Radiation Oncology and Gynecology departments.
            •	Medical Cooperation: If radiation therapy services like brachytherapy are unavailable at certain hospitals, partnerships with other institutions may facilitate access to necessary treatments.
            •	Referral Process: Institutions, such as Gunma University Hospital, coordinate radiation therapy through patient support centers and medical referrals.
            Summary of Cervical Cancer Radiation Therapy
            •	Standard Approach: The primary treatment combines external beam radiation and intracavitary irradiation. 3D-CRT is commonly used in Japan, with central shielding included in many cases.
            •	CCRT: Cisplatin is given weekly during radiation treatment, with 5-6 cycles in total.
            •	Interdepartmental Collaboration: Treatment involves close cooperation between Radiation Oncology and Gynecology, with referral systems in place for patients needing radiation therapy in hospitals lacking certain facilities.

            Product Overview:
            KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed by Merck, has shown promise in enhancing the body's immune response against cancer cells. In the context of cervical cancer, KEYTRUDA has been explored in the KEYNOTE-A18 trial—a pivotal study assessing its efficacy and safety when added to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with locally advanced disease.
            The KEYNOTE-A18 trial enrolled 1,060 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. Participants were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA or placebo in combination with standard CCRT. The dosing regimen included:
            •	Cycles 1-5: KEYTRUDA 200 mg or placebo every three weeks (Q3W), alongside cisplatin 40 mg/m² administered weekly (QW) and radiotherapy.
            •	Cycles 6-20: KEYTRUDA 400 mg or placebo every six weeks (Q6W).
            The primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results from the interim analyses were encouraging:
            •	First Interim Analysis:
            o	PFS hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.89; p=0.0020), indicating a 30% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the KEYTRUDA + CCRT group compared to the placebo + CCRT group.
            •	Second Interim Analysis:
            o	OS hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.90; p=0.0040), demonstrating a 33% reduction in the risk of death with the addition of KEYTRUDA.
            Adverse reactions were comparable between the two groups:
            •	First Interim Analysis:
            o	All-grade adverse reactions occurred in 96.0% of patients in both groups.
            o	Grade 3-5 adverse reactions were slightly higher in the KEYTRUDA group (67.0%) compared to the placebo group (60.6%).
            •	Second Interim Analysis:
            o	All-grade adverse reactions were reported in 97.0% (KEYTRUDA) and 96.8% (placebo) of patients.
            o	Grade 3-5 adverse reactions occurred in 69.1% of the KEYTRUDA group versus 61.3% in the placebo group.
            Clinical Practice and Prescribing Preferences:
            Despite the positive clinical trial results, the adoption of the KEYTRUDA + CCRT regimen (KEYNOTE-A18) for locally advanced cervical cancer in the perioperative period remains limited at this institution. Key factors influencing this include:
            •	Surgical Preference: When surgery is chosen as the primary treatment modality, the KEYNOTE-A18 regimen is not applicable. The institution follows Japanese guidelines, opting for radical hysterectomy with para-aortic lymph node dissection and postoperative chemotherapy for Stage III patients.
            •	Brachytherapy Limitations: The KEYNOTE-A18 regimen requires the use of brachytherapy as part of the treatment protocol. However, brachytherapy is not performed at this hospital due to the absence of necessary facilities and expertise. While there is potential to collaborate with university hospitals to provide brachytherapy, there has been no such experience to date.
            •	Medication Practices: For adjuvant therapy, the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is commonly prescribed. For patients with Stage 4B or recurrent cervical cancer, KEYTRUDA (based on the KEYNOTE-826 trial) and bevacizumab are utilized and have been steadily increasing in market share.
            Market Trends and Competitive Landscape:
            •	KEYNOTE-826 Success: The success of KEYTRUDA in the KEYNOTE-826 trial for Stage 4B and recurrent cervical cancer has led to its increased adoption in these settings.
            •	Limited Market for KEYNOTE-A18: The market for the KEYNOTE-A18 regimen in locally advanced cervical cancer remains small. This is primarily due to the requirement of brachytherapy—a treatment modality not widely available or practiced in all institutions—and the existing preference for surgical interventions in eligible patients.
            •	Lack of Competitors: Currently, there are no pharmaceutical competitors specifically targeting locally advanced cervical cancer in the perioperative period. This presents both an opportunity and a challenge in terms of introducing and integrating new treatment regimens like KEYNOTE-A18 into clinical practice.
